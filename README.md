# Seven_diff_CHESS

This code allows to generate a chessboard with n pieces in random positions. Then, we concatenate 2 images of chessboards in order to get a single image with 2 chessboards. 
The index of the images is set as follow : img_j_k where j is the number of image, for each j there are 7 image with k differences (in other words, k is the difference between img_j_k and img_j_0. 
This task belong to a set of cognitive tasks. The goal is to fetch for differences between 2 chessboards.
